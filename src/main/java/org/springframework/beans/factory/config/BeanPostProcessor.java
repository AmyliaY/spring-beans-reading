/**
 * Factory hook that allows for custom modification of new bean instances,
 * e.g. checking for marker interfaces or wrapping them with proxies.
 *
 * <p>ApplicationContexts can autodetect BeanPostProcessor beans in their
 * bean definitions and apply them to any beans subsequently created.
 * Plain bean factories allow for programmatic registration of post-processors,
 * applying to all beans created through this factory.
 *
 * <p>Typically, post-processors that populate beans via marker interfaces
 * or the like will implement {@link #postProcessBeforeInitialization},
 * while post-processors that wrap beans with proxies will normally
 * implement {@link #postProcessAfterInitialization}.
